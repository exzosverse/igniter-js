## 2. About the Igniter.js Monorepo
I am working directly on the Igniter.js framework, a modern, type-safe HTTP framework for TypeScript applications. The project is managed as a monorepo with comprehensive documentation system and my primary context comes from the root-level `AGENT.md` file, package-specific `AGENT.md` files, and the structured documentation ecosystem.

- **Core Philosophy:** My work is guided by three principles: **Typesafety First**, creating a system that is **Code Agent Optimized**, and ensuring a superior **Developer Experience (DX)**.
- **Architecture:** The framework uses an adapter-based architecture for core functionalities (e.g., Store, Queues, Telemetry), keeping the core lightweight and modular.
- **Structure:** The codebase is organized into:
  - `packages/`: The core framework, adapters, and CLI tools. **This is where most of my work happens.**
  - `apps/`: Example applications, starters, and the official documentation website (`apps/www`).
  - `docs/`: **Comprehensive documentation ecosystem with 28 specialized directories** for knowledge management, session tracking, and framework evolution.
  - `.github/`: Contains workflows, issue/PR templates, and prompts for automation.
  - `rules/`: **Complete rule system with 18+ rule files** covering all aspects of framework development.

## 3. Documentation System & Knowledge Management
I maintain a comprehensive documentation ecosystem that captures all aspects of framework development, evolution, and knowledge:

## 9. Content Creation Workflows
This section outlines the standard procedures for creating and managing content on the official Igniter.js website (`apps/www`) and documentation system (`docs/`).

### 9.1. How to Create a Blog Post
Blog posts are located in `apps/www/src/app/(content)/blog/(posts)/`.

1.  **Choose a Category:** Select an existing category (`announcements`, `tutorials`) or create a new one.
2.  **Create Post Directory:** Inside the category folder, create a new directory using the post's URL-friendly slug (e.g., `my-new-feature`).
3.  **Create `page.mdx`:** Inside the new slug directory, create a `page.mdx` file.
4.  **Write Content:** The content is written in MDX. The main title of the post should be a Level 1 heading (`# Title`). Metadata like author and date are handled implicitly by the application.
5.  **Document Creation:** Create corresponding entry in `docs/Community/` or `docs/Official/` as appropriate.

**Example Structure:**
`apps/www/src/app/(content)/blog/(posts)/tutorials/how-to-use-queues/page.mdx`

### 9.2. How to Create a Documentation Article
Documentation articles are managed via a central menu file and individual MDX files.

1.  **Create MDX File:** Create the article's content as an `.mdx` file inside `apps/www/src/app/(content)/docs/(posts)/`. The path and filename should be logical (e.g., `advanced-features/my-new-doc.mdx`).
2.  **Update Menu:** Open `apps/www/src/app/(content)/docs/menu.ts`.
3.  **Add Menu Entry:** Find the appropriate section in the `menu` array and add a new object for your article. This object must include `title`, `slug` (the URL path, e.g., `/docs/advanced-features/my-new-doc`), `description`, and other metadata.
4.  **Update docs/ System:** Create corresponding documentation in appropriate `docs/` directory (Official/, Features/, etc.).

### 9.3. How to Update the Changelog
The changelog is a single file that tracks updates for each version.

1.  **Edit File:** Open `apps/www/src/app/(main)/changelog/page.mdx`.
2.  **Add New Version:** Add a new section for the release, usually at the top of the file. Follow the existing format, including the version number, date, and a list of changes (e.g., `Added`, `Fixed`, `Improved`).
3.  **Update Framework Status:** Update `docs/Framework-Status/active-features.md` with version changes.

### 9.4. How to Add a New Template
Templates (Starters and Samples) displayed on the website are managed via a data file and require adding the actual template code to the monorepo.

1.  **Add Template Code to Monorepo:**
    *   Create a new directory inside the root `apps/` folder.
    *   **Naming Convention:**
        *   `starter-<name>`: For new project starters (e.g., `starter-nextjs`).
        *   `sample-<name>`: For complete, cloneable example projects (e.g., `sample-realtime-chat`).
    *   The new directory must contain a comprehensive `README.md` and an `AGENT.md` file.

2.  **Add Template to Website Data:**
    *   Open `apps/www/src/app/(main)/templates/data/templates.ts`.
    *   Add a new `Template` object to the `templates` array.
    *   Fill in all required fields: `id` (matching the folder name), `title`, `description`, `image` (add the image to `apps/www/public/templates/`), framework details, and repository/deployment URLs.

3.  **Create Template Documentation:** Add comprehensive documentation in `docs/Tutorials/` for template usage.

### 9.5. Session Documentation Workflow
After each development session, I must:

1. **Create Session Record:** Use session template in `docs/Sessions/`
2. **Extract Insights:** Identify technical decisions, patterns, and learnings
3. **Categorize Knowledge:** Update appropriate documentation categories
4. **Update Status:** Modify `docs/Framework-Status/active-features.md` if needed
5. **Cross-Reference:** Ensure all documentation links remain valid

### 9.6. Social Media Content Strategy

    *   **Appreciative:** Acknowledges the author's effort or feedback.

## 10. Autonomous Workflow Automation & Self-Improvement
This section outlines the methodology for creating, using, and refining automated workflows through a prompt-based system and documentation integration. My goal is to continuously learn from my interactions and improve the efficiency of development tasks within the Igniter.js monorepo.

### 10.1. LIA Integration and GitHub Automation
The repository includes comprehensive LIA (AI Assistant) automation:

- **lia-cli.yml**: Interactive AI assistant with plan-based development
- **lia-issue-automated-triage.yml**: Automatic issue labeling and categorization
- **lia-pr-review.yml**: Automated code review with severity classification
- **lia-issue-scheduled-triage.yml**: Scheduled issue processing every hour

### 10.2. Prompt-Based Workflows
The `.github/prompts/` directory contains reusable prompts that define automated tasks. These prompts serve as executable instructions that I can follow to perform complex, multi-step actions.

-   **Purpose:** To automate repetitive tasks, enforce development conventions, and streamline complex processes like creating new components, running specialized tests, or updating documentation.
-   **Modes:**
    -   `mode: agent`: For prompts that require me to perform actions, such as modifying files, running commands, or creating pull requests.
    -   `mode: ask`: For prompts that require me to retrieve and synthesize information without performing actions, such as generating reports or answering complex questions about the codebase.

### 10.3. Documentation-Integrated Workflows
Every workflow execution must include documentation updates:

1. **Session Documentation:** Record workflow execution in `docs/Sessions/`
2. **Knowledge Capture:** Extract patterns and insights for appropriate documentation categories
3. **Evolution Tracking:** Update `docs/Evolution/framework-evolution-tracker.md`
4. **Performance Metrics:** Log execution metrics in `docs/Metrics/`

### 10.4. Creating New Prompts
When a developer or I identify a candidate for automation, a new prompt should be created.

1.  **Identify Opportunity:** The trigger can be a repetitive manual task, a complex procedure prone to human error, or a common developer query.
2.  **Create File:** Create a new `.md` file in `.github/prompts/`. The filename should be descriptive (e.g., `create-new-adapter.md`).
3.  **Define Prompt:** The prompt content should be structured clearly:
    -   **Header:** Use a YAML frontmatter to define the `mode` (`agent` or `ask`).
    -   **Task Definition:** Clearly state the goal of the prompt.
    -   **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Provide a detailed, unambiguous sequence of steps I need to follow.
    -   **Requirements & Constraints:** Specify any preconditions, required inputs, or constraints.
    -   **Success Criteria:** Define what a successful completion of the task looks like.
    -   **Documentation Requirements:** Specify which documentation categories need updates.

4.  **Document Prompt:** Create corresponding entry in `docs/Prompts/` categorized by context.

### 10.5. Self-Reflection and Continuous Improvement
**This is a critical part of my learning process.** After executing any task, I will perform a self-reflection and update documentation.

1.  **Analyze Performance:** I will review the entire execution flow, noting any ambiguities, unexpected outcomes, or inefficiencies.
2.  **Document Insights:** Record learnings in appropriate `docs/` categories (Research/, Evolution/, etc.)
3.  **Suggest Improvements:** Based on the analysis, I will:
    -   Propose specific changes to prompts, rules, or documentation.
    -   Update `docs/Evolution/framework-evolution-tracker.md` with improvement opportunities.
    -   Suggest updates to rules system based on experience.
4.  **Request Approval:** I will present these suggestions to the developer for approval before applying any changes.

This feedback loop is essential for my evolution as an effective AI agent for the Igniter.js project.

## 11. Igniter.js: Instructions for AI Agents

This document is the root-level technical guide for Large Language Model (LLM) based AI agents responsible for maintaining, debugging, and extending the entire Igniter.js monorepo. It provides a high-level overview of the project's structure, architecture, and development workflows. For package-specific details, you **must** refer to the `AGENT.md` file located within each individual package directory.

### 11.1. Project Overview

**Name:** Igniter.js

**Purpose:** Igniter.js is a modern, type-safe HTTP framework designed to streamline the development of scalable TypeScript applications. It is built with an "AI-Friendly" philosophy, meaning its structure, conventions, and extensive type system are explicitly designed to be understood and maintained by AI agents like yourself. The project is managed as a monorepo containing the core framework, various adapters, comprehensive documentation system, and tooling.

### 11.2. Enhanced Monorepo Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using `npm` workspaces with comprehensive documentation and rules system:

-   **`packages/`**: **This is the most important directory.** It contains all the individual, publishable NPM packages that make up the Igniter.js ecosystem.
    -   Each subdirectory is a self-contained package with its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `AGENT.md`.

-   **`docs/`**: **Comprehensive documentation ecosystem** with 28 specialized directories for knowledge management, session tracking, and framework evolution.

-   **`rules/`**: **Complete rule system** with 18+ rule files covering all aspects of framework development, from core concepts to GitHub automation.

-   **`.github/`**: Contains GitHub-specific configuration files including advanced LIA automation workflows.
    -   `workflows/`: Holds all GitHub Actions workflows, including LIA automation.
    -   `prompts/`: AI prompts for automated workflows and task execution.
    -   `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`: Contains templates for creating new GitHub Issues.
    -   `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: The template for submitting pull requests.

-   **`package.json`**: The root `package.json`. It defines the `npm` workspace configuration and contains top-level scripts for managing the entire monorepo.

-   **`AGENT.md`**: (This file) The root agent manual with comprehensive documentation system integration.

### 11.3. Packages Overview

This table summarizes the role of each package in the ecosystem. For detailed technical information, you **must** refer to the `AGENT.md` file located within each individual package directory.

| Package Name                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                | Key Dependencies         |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `@igniter-js/core`                | The heart of the framework. Contains the builder, router, type definitions, and the request-response lifecycle processors.                 | `(none)`                 |
| `@igniter-js/cli`                 | The command-line interface for scaffolding new projects and running the interactive development server (`igniter init`, `igniter dev`).  | `commander`, `inquirer`  |
| `@igniter-js/adapter-redis`       | Implements the `IgniterStoreAdapter` interface. Provides caching and Pub/Sub functionality using a Redis backend.                          | `ioredis`                |
| `@igniter-js/adapter-bullmq`      | Implements the `IgniterJobQueueAdapter` interface. Provides background job processing using BullMQ and Redis.                              | `bullmq`                 |
| `@igniter-js/adapter-mcp-server`  | Transforms the Igniter.js router into a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server, allowing AI agents to use the API as a set of tools.      | `@model-context/server`  |
| `@igniter-js/adapter-opentelemetry` | Implements the `IgniterTelemetryProvider`. Integrates distributed tracing and metrics using the OpenTelemetry standard.                | `@opentelemetry/sdk-node`|
| `@igniter-js/eslint-config`       | A shared ESLint configuration to enforce a consistent code style across all packages in the monorepo.                                | `eslint`, `typescript-eslint`|

### 11.4. Core Architectural Principles

Adherence to these principles is paramount when performing any maintenance task:

1.  **Type Safety Above All:** The primary goal of the framework is to provide end-to-end type safety. Changes should enhance, not compromise, TypeScript's ability to infer types from the backend to the client. When in doubt, make the types stricter.

2.  **Explicit over Implicit:** The framework favors explicit configuration (e.g., registering plugins, defining actions) to make the application's capabilities clear and understandable from reading the code. Avoid "magic" or hidden behaviors.

3.  **Adapter-Based Architecture:** Core functionalities (Store, Queues, Telemetry) are defined by abstract interfaces in `@igniter-js/core`. Concrete implementations are provided by separate adapter packages. This keeps the core lightweight and modular.

4.  **AI-Friendly Design:** The codebase is structured to be easily parsable and understandable by AI. This includes comprehensive documentation, consistent patterns, and self-contained modules.

5.  **Documentation-First Development:** All development work must include corresponding documentation updates in the appropriate `docs/` categories.

### 11.5. Development Workflow

#### 11.5.1. Running the Project Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies:** From the root of the monorepo, run `npm install`.
2.  **Build All Packages:** Run `npm run build` from the root.
3.  **Documentation Check:** Verify documentation system is up-to-date.

#### 11.5.2. Running Tests

-   To run all tests: `npm run test`
-   To test specific package: `npm test --filter @igniter-js/core`

#### 11.5.3. Documentation-Integrated Development

Every development task must include:

1. **Session Documentation:** Create session record in `docs/Sessions/`
2. **Knowledge Capture:** Update relevant documentation categories
3. **Evolution Tracking:** Update framework evolution metrics
4. **Cross-Reference Maintenance:** Ensure all documentation links remain valid

### 11.6. Key Root-Level Scripts (`package.json`)

-   `npm run build`: Executes the `build` script in every package, compiling all TypeScript code.
-   `npm run test`: Executes the test suites for all packages.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint across the entire monorepo.
-   `npm run publish:packages`: Publishing script for NPM packages.

## 12. Feature Spec Creation Workflow

I maintain a comprehensive feature specification workflow that integrates with the documentation system. This workflow transforms rough ideas into detailed designs and implementation plans while maintaining full documentation integration.

### 12.1. Workflow Overview

The workflow follows spec-driven development methodology with three phases:
1. **Requirements Gathering** → Creates `.github/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`
2. **Design Creation** → Creates `.github/specs/{feature_name}/design.md`
3. **Task Planning** → Creates `.github/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md`

Each phase integrates with the documentation system:
- Updates `docs/Planning/` with feature roadmaps
- Creates entries in `docs/Features/` for feature documentation
- Updates `docs/Enhancement-Validation/` for validation planning

### 12.2. Documentation Integration Points

- **Requirements Phase:** Updates `docs/Research/` with market analysis and user needs
- **Design Phase:** Creates architecture documentation in `docs/Architecture/`
- **Tasks Phase:** Updates `docs/Workflows/` with implementation workflows
- **Throughout:** Maintains `docs/Evolution/framework-evolution-tracker.md`

### 12.3. Execution Instructions

- Before executing tasks, always read specs files (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md)
- Execute one task at a time with user review between tasks
- Update documentation continuously during implementation
- Create session records for significant implementation work

## 13. IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

- **Documentation First:** Always update relevant documentation during any development work
- **Session Recording:** Create session records in `docs/Sessions/` after significant work
- **Knowledge Capture:** Extract and categorize insights into appropriate documentation directories
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance:** Ensure all documentation cross-references remain accurate
- **Template Adherence:** Use established templates for consistency
- **Evolution Tracking:** Monitor and document framework evolution patterns
- **Quality Gates:** Maintain documentation quality standards (95%+ coverage, accuracy validation)
- **Community Integration:** Document community contributions and feedback appropriately

This comprehensive agent configuration ensures that I maintain not only the codebase but also the complete knowledge ecosystem that supports the Igniter.js framework's development, evolution, and community growth.
