## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's fixing a typo, improving documentation, or adding a new feature, your help is appreciated.

### Adding or Editing Documentation

Our documentation is written in MDX (`.mdx`).

1.  **Find the Content:** The documentation files are located in the `src/content/docs` directory (or a similar location, please verify). The file and folder structure in this directory maps directly to the URL paths.
2.  **Make Your Changes:** Create a new file or edit an existing one. You can use standard Markdown syntax as well as custom React components found in `src/components/mdx/`.
3.  **Update Navigation (if needed):** If you add a new page, you may need to add it to the sidebar navigation. This is typically configured in a file like `src/configs/docs-nav.ts`.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Commit your changes and open a pull request against the `main` branch of the monorepo.
