# Installation

Welcome to Igniter.js! This guide provides everything you need to get started, whether you're building a new application from the ground up or integrating Igniter.js into an existing project. Our goal is to get you running in minutes.

## 1. Start with a Template

The fastest and most effective way to start a new project is with one of our official templates. These are production-ready boilerplates, meticulously configured with best practices, end-to-end type safety, and all the essential tooling. They embody our development philosophy, saving you valuable setup time.

### Official Project Starters

## 2. Use the `igniter init` CLI

If our templates don't perfectly match your requirements, the `igniter init` command is your best alternative. This interactive CLI scaffolds a clean, structured project, giving you the freedom to choose your own integrations while still benefiting from our proven project setup.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npx @igniter-js/cli init my-new-app
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm dlx @igniter-js/cli init my-new-app
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="bun">
  ```bash
  bunx @igniter-js/cli init my-new-app
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

For a detailed walkthrough of the CLI, please see our **[Quick Start Guide](/docs/getting-started/quick-start-guide)**.

## 3. Manual Installation for Existing Projects

For those who wish to integrate Igniter.js into an existing codebase, a manual setup is the way to go. This approach allows you to adopt our framework incrementally, without needing to refactor your entire project.

Simply install the core package using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @igniter-js/core
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @igniter-js/core
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm add @igniter-js/core
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="bun">
  ```bash
  bun add @igniter-js/core
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

This single package gives you access to the core builder, router, and all the foundational tools needed to bring type-safe APIs to your application.

## 4. Optional: Add Adapters and Dependencies

Igniter.js features a powerful, adapter-based architecture. This means advanced functionalities like caching, background jobs, and observability are handled by separate, dedicated packages. This keeps the framework's core lightweight and ensures you only install what you truly need.

### Store Adapter (Caching & Pub/Sub)

For a high-performance Redis-based store, install the adapter and its peer dependencies. For a seamless TypeScript experience, we also recommend installing the type definitions.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @igniter-js/adapter-redis ioredis
  npm install @types/ioredis --save-dev
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @igniter-js/adapter-redis ioredis
  yarn add @types/ioredis --dev
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

### Queues Adapter (Background Jobs)

To enable robust background job processing powered by BullMQ, install the official adapter and its dependency.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @igniter-js/adapter-bullmq bullmq
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @igniter-js/adapter-bullmq bullmq
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

### Telemetry Adapter (OpenTelemetry)

For comprehensive observability, install our OpenTelemetry adapter and its required peer dependencies.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @igniter-js/adapter-opentelemetry @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @igniter-js/adapter-opentelemetry @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

### MCP Server Adapter (AI Code Agents)

To transform your API into a set of executable tools for AI code agents, install our Model-Context Protocol (MCP) Server adapter.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install @igniter-js/adapter-mcp-server @vercel/mcp-adapter @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add @igniter-js/adapter-mcp-server @vercel/mcp-adapter @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>

### Validation with Zod

While optional, we highly recommend using `zod` for validating request bodies, queries, and parameters. It is deeply integrated into the Igniter.js type system.

<CodeGroup>
  <Code title="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install zod
  ```
  </Code>
  <Code title="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn add zod
  ```
  </Code>
</CodeGroup>
