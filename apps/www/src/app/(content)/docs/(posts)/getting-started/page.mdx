# Getting Started with Igniter.js

Welcome to Igniter.js! This is your central hub for mastering our framework. We've designed this guide to take you from initial setup to building robust, type-safe APIs, all while highlighting the best practices that define the Igniter.js developer experience.

<Callout type="tip" title="Our Philosophy">
  Igniter.js is built on three core principles: **End-to-End Typesafety**, a superior **Developer Experience (DX)**, and an **AI-Friendly Architecture**. You'll see these principles in action as you move through our documentation.
