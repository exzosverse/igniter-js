# Introducing Igniter.js Templates: Kickstart Your Next Project in Minutes

We're excited to announce the launch of **Igniter.js Templates** – a curated collection of production-ready starter templates that help you build modern full-stack applications faster than ever before. Whether you're building a React SPA, a Next.js application, or a REST API, our templates provide the perfect foundation with best practices baked in.

## Why Templates Matter

Starting a new project often involves hours of setup: configuring build tools, setting up databases, implementing authentication, and establishing project structure. With Igniter.js Templates, we've eliminated this friction by providing battle-tested starter projects that follow industry best practices and leverage the full power of the Igniter.js ecosystem.

## Available Templates

Our initial collection includes six carefully crafted templates, each designed for specific use cases:

| Template | Stack | Link |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Next.js Full-Stack App** | Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma | [View Template](/templates/starter-nextjs) |
| **Bun + React SPA** | Bun, React 18, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL | [View Template](/templates/starter-bun-react-app) |
| **TanStack Start App** | TanStack Start, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma | [View Template](/templates/starter-tanstack-start) |
| **Express REST API** | Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma | [View Template](/templates/starter-express-rest-api) |
| **Bun REST API** | Bun, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma | [View Template](/templates/starter-bun-rest-api) |
| **Deno REST API** | Deno, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma | [View Template](/templates/starter-deno-rest-api) |

## Getting Started

Getting started with any template is incredibly simple:

```bash
# Install the Igniter.js CLI
npm install -g @igniter-js/cli

# Create a new project from a template
igniter create my-app

# Follow the interactive prompts to select your template
# The CLI will guide you through the setup process
```

Alternatively, you can specify a template directly:

```bash
# Create a Next.js app
igniter create my-nextjs-app --template nextjs

# Create a Bun React SPA
igniter create my-bun-app --template bun-react

# Create an Express API
igniter create my-api --template express-api
```

## Template Architecture

Each template follows a consistent, scalable architecture:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── features/          # Feature-based organization
│   ├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── lib/              # Utility functions
│   └── types/            # TypeScript definitions
├── prisma/               # Database schema and migrations
├── public/               # Static assets
├── docker-compose.yml    # Local development services
└── .env.example         # Environment configuration
```

### Feature-Based Organization
All templates use a feature-based folder structure that scales with your application:

```
src/features/
├── auth/
│   ├── components/       # Auth-specific components
│   ├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
│   ├── services/        # API calls and business logic
│   └── types/           # Auth-related types
└── dashboard/
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── services/
    └── types/
```
