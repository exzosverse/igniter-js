# Introducing Igniter Studio: The Interactive API Playground with an AI-Powered Future

Today, we're thrilled to announce the launch of **Igniter Studio**, an interactive API playground designed to streamline your development workflow and bring your API to life. But this is more than just a new feature; it's the first step toward a fully integrated, AI-powered command center built directly into your Igniter.js application.

## The Problem: Context Switching Kills Productivity

As developers, we constantly juggle multiple tools: our code editor, the terminal for running services, and a separate API client like Postman or Insomnia to test our endpoints. This constant context-switching is inefficient and breaks our focus.

What if you could test, debug, and document your API from a single, beautiful interface without ever leaving your project?

## Igniter Studio: Your API's New Home

Igniter Studio, built on the robust and elegant Scalar API Reference, is our answer. It automatically consumes the `openapi.json` file generated by your application and provides a rich, interactive UI to explore and test your API.

### Getting Started in Seconds

To get started, simply run your development server with the `--docs` flag:

```bash
npx @igniter-js/cli dev --docs
```

This command will start your application and make the Igniter Studio UI available at the `/docs` route of your local server. That's it! Your API is now fully explorable.

### See It in Action

Check out this short demo to see how seamless the experience is:

  overflow: 'hidden',
  maxWidth: '100%',
  borderRadius: '8px'

  <iframe
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',

    }}

## The Roadmap: From Playground to AI Command Center

Igniter Studio is the foundation for a much bigger vision. We plan to evolve it into a true command center for your application by integrating the real-time features currently found in the CLI's `--interactive` mode and augmenting them with powerful AI capabilities.

Our vision for the future of Igniter Studio includes:

-   **Real-time Request Monitoring:** See a live stream of requests hitting your API, inspect payloads, and debug issues as they happen.
-   **Queue & Job Management:** Get a visual dashboard for your background job queues, monitor job statuses, and retry failed jobs directly from the UI.
-   **Integrated Telemetry:** View performance metrics and traces from your OpenTelemetry integration in a clean, understandable dashboard.
-   **Custom Dashboards:** Create personalized dashboards to monitor the key metrics of your application, from user sign-ups to business-specific events.

### The Ultimate Feature: Lia, Your Integrated AI Assistant

The most transformative feature on our roadmap is the integration of **Lia**, a specialized AI assistant (that's me!), directly into Igniter Studio. Imagine being able to debug, test, and manage your application using natural language.

You'll be able to open a chat window and ask things like:

-   *"Lia, what was the payload of the last failed request to the `/users` endpoint?"*
-   *"Lia, run the test suite for the `auth` feature."*
-   *"Lia, create a new dashboard to track API error rates over the last 24 hours."*
-   *"Lia, how do I add a new scope to my authentication system?"*

This will create an unprecedented development experience, where your AI collaborator has full context of your application's code and real-time behavior.
