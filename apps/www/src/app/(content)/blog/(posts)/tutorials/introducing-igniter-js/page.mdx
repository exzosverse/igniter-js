In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, developers are constantly seeking tools that not only boost productivity but also ensure code reliability and maintainability. Today, we're excited to introduce **Igniter.js**, a groundbreaking TypeScript framework that redefines how we build full-stack applications with unprecedented type safety, seamless AI integration, and an exceptional developer experience.

Created by [Felipe Barcelos](https://github.com/felipebarcelospro), Igniter.js emerges from years of experience building scalable web applications and recognizing the gaps in existing solutions. This framework addresses the fundamental challenges developers face when building modern applications: maintaining type safety across the entire stack, managing complex state synchronization, and integrating AI capabilities without sacrificing performance or developer experience.

## The Problem with Current Full-Stack Development

Modern web development often involves juggling multiple technologies, each with its own paradigms and type systems. Developers typically face several challenges:

### 1. **Type Safety Boundaries**
Traditional full-stack development creates artificial boundaries between frontend and backend code. Even with TypeScript on both sides, the communication layer—APIs, database queries, and client-server interactions—often lacks proper type safety, leading to runtime errors and maintenance headaches.

### 2. **Complex State Management**
Keeping client-side state synchronized with server-side data requires intricate solutions involving caching, invalidation strategies, and real-time updates. Most frameworks treat these as separate concerns, adding complexity to the development process.

### 3. **AI Integration Complexity**
As AI becomes integral to modern applications, developers struggle with type-safe AI integrations, prompt management, and maintaining consistency across different AI providers and models.

### 4. **Developer Experience Fragmentation**
Developers often switch between different mental models, toolchains, and debugging approaches when working across the stack, reducing productivity and increasing cognitive load.

## Enter Igniter.js: A Paradigm Shift

Igniter.js addresses these challenges through a unified, type-safe approach that treats your entire application as a cohesive system rather than separate frontend and backend components.

### Core Philosophy

Igniter.js is built on three fundamental principles:

1. **End-to-End Type Safety**: Every piece of data flowing through your application is type-safe, from database queries to UI components.
2. **Developer Experience First**: The framework prioritizes intuitive APIs, excellent tooling, and minimal boilerplate.
3. **AI-Native Architecture**: AI integration is a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

## Key Features That Set Igniter.js Apart

### 1. **Type-Safe RPC with Builder Pattern**

Igniter.js introduces a revolutionary approach to API development using a builder pattern that ensures complete type safety:

```typescript
// Define a controller with full type safety
export const userController = igniter.controller({
  path: '/users',
  actions: {
    // Type-safe query with automatic validation
    list: igniter.query({
      path: '/',
      params: z.object({
        page: z.number().min(1).default(1),
        limit: z.number().min(1).max(100).default(10)
      }),
      handler: async ({ params, context, response }) => {
        const users = await context.database.user.findMany({
          skip: (params.page - 1) * params.limit,
          take: params.limit
        });
        
        return response.success({ users, total: users.length });
      }
    }),
    
    // Type-safe mutation with automatic revalidation
    create: igniter.mutation({
      path: '/',
      method: 'POST',
      body: z.object({
        name: z.string().min(1),
        email: z.string().email()
      }),
      handler: async ({ request, context, response }) => {
        const user = await context.database.user.create({
          data: request.body
        });
        
        // Automatically trigger client-side revalidation
        return response.created(user).revalidate(['users.list']);
      }
    })
  }
});
```

On the client side, consuming this API is equally type-safe and intuitive:

```tsx
'use client';

import { api } from '@/igniter.client';

function UsersList() {
  // Fully typed query with automatic caching and revalidation
  const usersQuery = api.users.list.useQuery({
    page: 1,
    limit: 10
  });
  
  const createUserMutation = api.users.create.useMutation({
    onSuccess: () => {
      // Automatic revalidation triggered by server response
      console.log('User created and list updated!');
    }
  });
  
  if (usersQuery.isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading users...</div>;
  }
  
  return (
    <div>
      {usersQuery.data?.users.map(user => (
        <div key={user.id}>{user.name} - {user.email}</div>
      ))}
      
      <button 
        onClick={() => createUserMutation.mutate({
          name: 'John Doe',
          email: 'john@example.com'
        })}
        disabled={createUserMutation.isPending}
      >
        {createUserMutation.isPending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create User'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. **Integrated Queue System for Background Processing**

Igniter.js includes a first-class queue system built on [BullMQ](https://docs.bullmq.io/), enabling reliable background job processing with full type safety:

```typescript
// Define type-safe background jobs
export const emailJobRouter = jobs.router({
  namespace: 'emails',
  jobs: {
    sendWelcomeEmail: jobs.job({
      input: z.object({
        userId: z.string(),
        email: z.string().email()
      }),
      handler: async ({ input, context }) => {
        const user = await context.database.user.findUnique({
          where: { id: input.userId }
        });
        
        if (!user) {
          throw new Error('User not found');
        }
        
        await context.email.send({
          to: input.email,
          template: 'welcome',
          data: { userName: user.name }
        });
        
        return { success: true, sentAt: new Date() };
      }
    })
  }
});

// Dispatch jobs from anywhere in your application
const result = await emailJobRouter.sendWelcomeEmail.dispatch({
  userId: '123',
  email: 'user@example.com'
}, {
  delay: 5000, // Send after 5 seconds
  attempts: 3   // Retry up to 3 times on failure
});
```

### 3. **Real-Time Updates with Server-Sent Events**

Igniter.js provides seamless real-time functionality using Server-Sent Events (SSE), offering better performance and simpler implementation compared to WebSockets for most use cases:

```typescript
// Server-side: Automatic revalidation triggers
export const postController = igniter.controller({
  path: '/posts',
  actions: {
    create: igniter.mutation({
      path: '/',
      method: 'POST',
      body: z.object({
        title: z.string(),
        content: z.string()
      }),
      handler: async ({ request, context, response }) => {
        const post = await context.database.post.create({
          data: request.body
        });
        
        // Automatically notify all connected clients
        return response.created(post).revalidate(['posts.list']);
      }
    })
  }
});
```

```tsx
// Client-side: Automatic real-time updates
function PostsList() {
  // This query automatically updates when server triggers revalidation
  const postsQuery = api.posts.list.useQuery();
  
  // No additional code needed for real-time updates!
  return (
    <div>
      {postsQuery.data?.posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. **AI-Native Integration**

Igniter.js treats AI as a first-class citizen with built-in support for multiple providers, type-safe prompt management, and seamless integration:

```typescript
// Type-safe AI integration
export const aiController = igniter.controller({
  path: '/ai',
  actions: {
    generateContent: igniter.mutation({
      path: '/generate',
      method: 'POST',
      body: z.object({
        prompt: z.string(),
        model: z.enum(['gpt-4', 'claude-3', 'gemini-pro'])
      }),
      handler: async ({ request, context, response }) => {
        const result = await context.ai.generate({
          model: request.body.model,
          prompt: request.body.prompt,
          maxTokens: 1000
        });
        
        return response.success({ 
          content: result.content,
          usage: result.usage 
        });
      }
    })
  }
});
```

## Framework-Agnostic Architecture

One of Igniter.js's greatest strengths is its framework-agnostic approach. While it provides excellent integration with popular frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start), it's designed to work with any frontend framework or even vanilla JavaScript:
