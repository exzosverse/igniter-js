# Welcome to the Igniter.js Wiki!

Welcome to the official documentation and community hub for Igniter.js, the AI-Friendly, Typesafe Framework for Modern TypeScript Applications.

This Wiki is your comprehensive guide to understanding the framework's philosophy, architecture, features, and usage patterns. Whether you are just getting started or are building complex applications, you will find everything you need right here.

## Core Philosophy

Igniter.js is built on three core principles:

1.  **Typesafety First**: Every feature is designed to maximize TypeScript's inference. Our goal is to ensure that if your code compiles, it works as expected.
2.  **AI Friendly**: The framework's structure, clear conventions, and comprehensive type system are explicitly designed to be easily understood and leveraged by AI code generation agents.
3.  **Developer Experience (DX)**: We strive to create code that is not only functional but also a joy to read, maintain, and extend.
