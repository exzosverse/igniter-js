# AI Agent Maintenance Manual: `@igniter-js/core`

**Version:** 1.0.0
**For AI Agent:** You are an expert TypeScript software engineer. This document is your primary technical guide to the `@igniter-js/core` package. Read and understand it thoroughly before attempting any modifications. Your goal is to perform maintenance tasks accurately, respecting the architectural principles outlined here.

---

## 1. Package Overview

### 1.1. Package Name
`@igniter-js/core`

### 1.2. Purpose
This package is the heart of the Igniter.js framework. It contains all the essential, non-adapter-specific logic for building, configuring, and running a type-safe API. It provides the foundational building blocks, including the main builder, the request processing pipeline, all core TypeScript interfaces, and the client-side hooks. This package is a required dependency for any application built with Igniter.js.

---

## 2. Architecture & Key Concepts

Understanding the core architecture is critical for successful maintenance. The framework is built on several key principles and patterns.

### 2.1. The Builder Pattern: `IgniterBuilder`

The entire application is constructed using a fluent (chainable) builder API, starting with the `Igniter` object exported from `builder.service.ts`.

*   **Why it's used:** This pattern enforces a structured and guided setup process. It allows the framework to build up its type system dynamically. As you chain methods like `.store(redisAdapter)` or `.jobs(bullmqAdapter)`, the builder not only registers the functionality but also injects the corresponding types into the global `igniter` instance and the request `context`.
*   **The Flow:**
    1.  `Igniter.context<T>()`: **Always the first call.** It sets the base type for the application's global context.
    2.  `.logger()`, `.store()`, `.jobs()`, `.plugins()`: These methods attach modules and extend the framework's capabilities and types.
    3.  `.create()`: **Always the final call.** It consumes the entire configuration and returns a fully-typed, immutable `igniter` instance. This instance holds the factory functions (`.query()`, `.mutation()`, `.controller()`, etc.) that you use to build your API.

### 2.2. The Request Processing Lifecycle

When an HTTP `Request` arrives, it's processed through a pipeline of specialized "processors". Understanding this flow is essential for debugging and adding new features.

1.  **Entry Point (`RequestProcessor.process`)**: The `handler` method of your `AppRouter` calls `RequestProcessor.process(request)`. This is the orchestrator for the entire lifecycle.

2.  **Route Resolution (`RouteResolverProcessor`)**: The processor first matches the incoming request's method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) and path (`/users/123`) to a specific `IgniterAction` that you defined in a controller. If no route is found, a `404 Not Found` response is returned immediately.

3.  **Context Building (`ContextBuilderProcessor`)**: Once a route is matched, the `ContextBuilderProcessor` creates the initial `ProcessedContext`. This involves:
    *   Parsing the request `URL` to extract query parameters.
    *   Parsing the request `body` based on the `Content-Type` header (`BodyParserProcessor`).
    *   Creating the base application context by calling your `createIgniterAppContext` function.
    *   Attaching core services (logger, store, etc.) and registered plugins to the context.

4.  **Middleware Execution (`MiddlewareExecutorProcessor`)**: This processor executes all `Procedures` (middleware) associated with the action in sequence. This is a critical step:
    *   Each procedure receives the current, up-to-date context.
    *   If a procedure returns an object, that object's properties are **deeply merged** into the context.
    *   This dynamically and safely extends the context, making new data (e.g., an authenticated `user` object) available to subsequent procedures and the final action handler.
    *   The type system tracks these changes, ensuring type safety throughout the chain.
    *   If a procedure returns a `Response` object, the request is "short-circuited," and the response is sent immediately.

5.  **Action Handler Execution**: The `handler` function of the matched `IgniterAction` is finally executed. It receives the fully-enriched `IgniterActionContext`, which contains the request details, the extended application context, response helpers, and plugin accessors.

6.  **Response Processing (`ResponseProcessor`)**: The value returned by your action handler is processed. If you return a plain object, it's converted into a standard JSON `Response`. If you use the `response` helpers (e.g., `response.success()`, `response.unauthorized()`), the `IgniterResponseProcessor` constructs the appropriate HTTP `Response` with the correct status code and headers.

7.  **Error Handling (`ErrorHandlerProcessor`)**: If an error is thrown at *any point* in this lifecycle, it is caught by the `ErrorHandlerProcessor`. This processor normalizes the error and converts it into a standardized JSON error `Response`, ensuring that clients always receive a consistent error format.

### 2.3. Dependency Injection via Context

The **Context** is the sole dependency injection (DI) mechanism in Igniter.js.
*   **Global Context**: Contains singleton services (like a database client) that are available application-wide.
*   **Request-Scoped Context**: The global context is cloned for each request and then dynamically extended by procedures. This is how request-specific data, like session information, is passed to your business logic without using global variables, ensuring proper isolation between requests.

---

## 3. File & Directory Map

This map outlines the purpose of each key file and directory within `packages/core/src`.

*   `src/index.ts`
    > **Purpose**: The public entry point of the `@igniter-js/core` package. It exports the primary `Igniter` builder, the `createIgniterPlugin` factories, and all essential types that developers need to interact with the framework.
    > **Maintenance**: When adding a new high-level exportable, add it here.

*   `src/services/`
    > **Purpose**: This directory contains the "factory" services. These are classes and functions responsible for **creating and configuring** the core components of the framework. You interact with these services to *build* your application.
    *   `builder.service.ts`: Contains the `IgniterBuilder` class. **This is the most important file in this directory.** It is the starting point of every application. Any new chainable method on the `Igniter` object (like a future `.cache()` method) would be added here.
    *   `action.service.ts`: Exports `createIgniterQuery` and `createIgniterMutation`. These factories produce the `IgniterAction` objects that define your API endpoints.
    *   `controller.service.ts`: Exports `createIgniterController`. A very simple factory that structures and groups a collection of actions under a common path.
    *   `procedure.service.ts`: Exports `createIgniterProcedure` and the enhanced builder/factories. This is where the logic for creating middleware resides.
    *   `router.service.ts`: Exports `createIgniterRouter`. This factory takes the final configuration (controllers, context, plugins) and produces the `AppRouter`, which is used by the `RequestProcessor`.
    *   `cookie.service.ts`: Contains the `IgniterCookie` class, a helper for parsing and serializing request/response cookies in a standardized way.
    *   `jobs.service.ts`: Defines the **structure** and **abstractions** for the Igniter.js Queues system (e.g., `JobsRegistry`, `JobsRouter`). The concrete implementation is provided by an adapter like `@igniter-js/adapter-bullmq`.
    *   `plugin.service.ts`: Contains the `IgniterPluginManager`. This is a sophisticated service that handles plugin registration, dependency resolution, lifecycle hook execution, and event bus management.
    *   `realtime.service.ts`: Implements the `IgniterRealtimeService`, providing the high-level API (`.publish()`, `.to()`, `.broadcast()`) for interacting with the SSE system.

*   `src/processors/`
    > **Purpose**: This directory contains the "worker" classes. These processors are internal to the framework and are responsible for **executing the steps of the request lifecycle**. You generally don't interact with these directly, but they are critical to how the framework operates.
    *   `request.processor.ts`: The primary orchestrator. Its `process` method takes an incoming `Request` and manages its flow through all other processors.
    *   `route-resolver.processor.ts`: Contains the logic to match a request's method and path against the registered routes.
    *   `context-builder.processor.ts`: Responsible for creating the `ProcessedContext` for a request.
    *   `middleware-executor.processor.ts`: Responsible for executing the `use` array of procedures for a given action.
    *   `body-parser.processor.ts`: A utility processor for parsing different `Content-Type` request bodies.
    *   `error-handler.processor.ts`: The centralized error handler for the entire request pipeline.
    *   `sse.processor.ts`: The low-level engine for managing Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections and channels. `IgniterRealtimeService` is a high-level API over this processor.
    *   `telemetry-manager.processor.ts`: Manages the creation and lifecycle of OpenTelemetry spans.

*   `src/types/`
    > **Purpose**: The "constitution" of the framework. This directory contains all core TypeScript `interface` and `type` definitions. **This is the most critical directory for understanding the framework's data structures.** Any change here has wide-ranging effects.
    *   `action.interface.ts`: Defines `IgniterAction`, `IgniterActionContext`, `IgniterQueryOptions`, `InferEndpoint`, etc. **This is arguably the most important type definition file.** It defines the shape of the `ctx` object passed to every handler.
    *   `client.interface.ts`: Defines all types related to the client-side hooks (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useRealtime`).
    *   `controller.interface.ts`: Defines `IgniterControllerConfig`.
    *   `procedure.interface.ts`: Defines `IgniterProcedure` and the types for the enhanced builder.
    *   `jobs.interface.ts`: Defines the canonical shapes for job queue adapters, routers, and job definitions (`IgniterJobQueueAdapter`, `JobsRouter`, `JobDefinition`).
    *   `store.interface.ts`: Defines the `IgniterStoreAdapter` interface, which is the contract for all store adapters (e.g., Redis).
    *   `plugin.interface.ts`: Defines the comprehensive `IgniterPlugin` interface and its related types.
    *   (and others...)

*   `src/client/`
    > **Purpose**: Contains code that is specifically intended for the client-side (frontend) portion of the Igniter.js ecosystem.
    *   `igniter.hooks.ts`: The React hook implementations for `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and `useRealtime`. This file is marked with `"use client";`.

*   `src/error/`
    > **Purpose**: Defines custom error classes for the framework.
    *   `index.ts`: Contains the `IgniterError` class, used for throwing structured, standardized errors within the framework.

*   `src/utils/`
    > **Purpose**: A collection of utility functions used throughout the core package, such as URL parsers, response helpers, and logging utilities.
    *   `logger.ts`: Contains centralized logging utilities (`resolveLogLevel`, `createLoggerContext`) that provide consistent logging behavior across all processors and services. These utilities handle environment variable resolution (`IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL`) with proper fallbacks and context creation for structured logging.

*   `src/adapters/`
    > **Purpose**: Contains built-in adapter implementations that don't require external dependencies.
    *   `telemetry.console.ts`: The default console-based telemetry adapter that implements `IgniterTelemetryProvider`. Uses the centralized logging system for consistent output formatting.

## 4. Logging System Architecture

### 4.1. Centralized Logging Philosophy

The Igniter.js core implements a centralized logging system designed for consistency, maintainability, and AI-friendly debugging. All logging throughout the framework follows these principles:

*   **Single Source of Truth**: All logging configuration is controlled by the `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
*   **Consistent Context**: Every log message includes structured context (component name, request ID when available)
*   **Appropriate Levels**: Log levels are used consistently across all components (ERROR for failures, WARN for recoverable issues, INFO for important events, DEBUG for detailed tracing)
*   **No Console Pollution**: Direct `console.*` calls are avoided in favor of the centralized logger

### 4.2. Core Logging Utilities (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

#### `resolveLogLevel(): IgniterLogLevel`
Resolves the logging level from environment variables with proper fallbacks:
- Reads `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
- Validates and normalizes the value
- Falls back to `WARN` level if invalid or missing
- Handles case-insensitive input ("debug", "DEBUG", "Debug")

#### `createLoggerContext(component: string, additionalContext?: Record<string, any>): Record<string, any>`
Creates structured logging context for consistent message formatting:
- Always includes the component name for easy filtering
- Optionally includes additional context (requestId, route, etc.)
- Returns a context object that can be passed to `IgniterConsoleLogger`

### 4.3. Logging Standards by Component Type

#### Services (`src/services/`)
Services use logging primarily for:
- **ERROR**: Configuration failures, plugin loading errors, critical service failures
- **WARN**: Deprecated usage, fallback behaviors, non-critical issues
- **INFO**: Service initialization, important state changes
- **DEBUG**: Detailed configuration, plugin registration, internal state

**Example Pattern:**
```typescript
const logger = new IgniterConsoleLogger(
  resolveLogLevel(),
  createLoggerContext('PluginManager')
);

logger.info('[PluginManager] Initialized with 5 plugins');
logger.debug('[PluginManager] Registered plugin: authentication');
```

#### Processors (`src/processors/`)
Processors handle request lifecycle and use logging for:
- **ERROR**: Request processing failures, unhandled exceptions
- **WARN**: Invalid requests, fallback behaviors, recoverable errors
- **INFO**: Rarely used (only for significant events like server startup)
- **DEBUG**: Request flow, middleware execution, route resolution
- **TRACE**: Detailed request/response data, performance metrics

**Example Pattern:**
```typescript
const logger = new IgniterConsoleLogger(
  resolveLogLevel(),
  createLoggerContext('RouteResolver', { requestId: context.requestId })
);

logger.debug('[RouteResolver] Resolving route for GET /api/users');
logger.error('[RouteResolver] No route found for GET /invalid-path');
```

### 4.4. Logging Maintenance Guidelines

#### When Adding New Components:
1. **Always use centralized utilities**: Import `resolveLogLevel` and `createLoggerContext` from `../utils/logger`
2. **Create component-specific context**: Use a descriptive component name (e.g., 'MiddlewareExecutor', 'BodyParser')
3. **Include request context when available**: Add `requestId`, `route`, or other relevant context
4. **Follow message formatting**: Use `[ComponentName]` prefix for easy filtering

#### When Refactoring Existing Code:
1. **Replace console.* calls**: Convert all direct console usage to logger calls
2. **Standardize log levels**: Review and adjust log levels according to the guidelines above
3. **Add structured context**: Ensure all log messages include relevant context
4. **Remove conditional logging**: Let the centralized system handle level filtering

#### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ❌ `if (config.debug) console.log(...)` - Use `logger.debug()` instead
- ❌ `console.error('Error:', error)` - Use `logger.error('[Component] Description', error)` instead
- ❌ Mixing `NODE_ENV` with logging levels - Use only `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL`
- ❌ Inconsistent message formatting - Always use `[ComponentName]` prefix

## 5. Processors & Services Deep Dive

### 5.1. Request Processing Pipeline Architecture

The request processing pipeline is the heart of Igniter.js. Understanding the flow and responsibilities of each processor is crucial for maintenance and debugging.

#### Pipeline Flow:
```
HTTP Request → RequestProcessor → RouteResolverProcessor → ContextBuilderProcessor → MiddlewareExecutorProcessor → Action Handler → ResponseProcessor → HTTP Response
                     ↓ (on error at any step)
                ErrorHandlerProcessor → Error Response
```

#### Processor Responsibilities:

**RequestProcessor** (`src/processors/request.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Orchestrates the entire request lifecycle
- **Logging**: Uses `[RequestProcessor]` context with requestId
- **Key Methods**: `process(request)` - main entry point
- **Error Handling**: Catches all errors and delegates to ErrorHandlerProcessor
- **Maintenance Notes**: This is the central coordinator; changes here affect the entire pipeline

**RouteResolverProcessor** (`src/processors/route-resolver.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Matches incoming requests to registered actions
- **Logging**: Uses `[RouteResolver]` context with requestId and route info
- **Key Methods**: `resolve(method, pathname, routes)` - returns matched action or null
- **Performance**: Critical for request latency; route matching algorithm should be optimized
- **Maintenance Notes**: When adding new route features (wildcards, parameters), modify this processor

**ContextBuilderProcessor** (`src/processors/context-builder.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Creates the initial ProcessedContext for the request
- **Logging**: Uses `[ContextBuilder]` context with requestId
- **Key Responsibilities**: URL parsing, body parsing delegation, context initialization
- **Integration Points**: Calls BodyParserProcessor, integrates with plugin system
- **Maintenance Notes**: Context shape changes require updates here

**MiddlewareExecutorProcessor** (`src/processors/middleware-executor.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Executes procedure chains (middleware) in sequence
- **Logging**: Uses `[MiddlewareExecutor]` context with requestId and procedure info
- **Key Features**: Context merging, short-circuiting on Response returns
- **Type Safety**: Maintains type safety through procedure chain execution
- **Maintenance Notes**: Critical for procedure system; changes affect all middleware

**BodyParserProcessor** (`src/processors/body-parser.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Parses request bodies based on Content-Type
- **Logging**: Uses `[BodyParser]` context with requestId and content type
- **Supported Types**: JSON, form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data, text, buffer
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed bodies
- **Maintenance Notes**: Add new content type support here

**ResponseProcessor** (`src/processors/response.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Converts action handler returns into HTTP Responses
- **Logging**: Uses `[ResponseProcessor]` context with requestId
- **Key Features**: JSON serialization, response helper integration, header management
- **Maintenance Notes**: Response format changes require updates here

**ErrorHandlerProcessor** (`src/processors/error-handler.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Normalizes all errors into consistent JSON responses
- **Logging**: Uses `[ErrorHandler]` context with requestId and error details
- **Error Types**: Handles IgniterError, validation errors, generic errors
- **Security**: Sanitizes error messages in production
- **Maintenance Notes**: Error format standardization happens here

**SSEProcessor** (`src/processors/sse.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Manages Server-Sent Events connections and channels
- **Logging**: Uses `[SSEProcessor]` context with connection and channel info
- **Key Features**: Connection management, channel subscriptions, message broadcasting
- **Integration**: Works with RealtimeService for high-level API
- **Maintenance Notes**: Real-time feature changes require updates here

**TelemetryManagerProcessor** (`src/processors/telemetry-manager.processor.ts`):
- **Primary Role**: Manages OpenTelemetry spans for request tracing
- **Logging**: Uses `[TelemetryManager]` context with span and trace info
- **Integration**: Works with telemetry adapters (OpenTelemetry, Console)
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead when telemetry is disabled
- **Maintenance Notes**: Tracing feature additions require updates here

### 5.2. Services Architecture

Services in Igniter.js are factory functions and classes that create and configure framework components. They are the "builder" layer that developers interact with.

#### Service Categories:

**Core Builder Services**:
- `builder.service.ts`: The main IgniterBuilder class with fluent API
- `action.service.ts`: Creates queries and mutations (API endpoints)
- `controller.service.ts`: Groups actions under common paths
- `procedure.service.ts`: Creates middleware/procedures
- `router.service.ts`: Assembles the final application router

**Runtime Services**:
- `plugin.service.ts`: Manages plugin lifecycle and event system
- `realtime.service.ts`: High-level API for Server-Sent Events
- `jobs.service.ts`: Job queue abstractions and registry
- `cookie.service.ts`: Cookie parsing and serialization utilities

#### Service Logging Patterns:

**Initialization Logging**:
```typescript
// Services log their initialization and configuration
logger.info('[PluginManager] Initialized with 3 plugins');
logger.debug('[PluginManager] Plugin load order: [auth, validation, cache]');
```

**Operation Logging**:
```typescript
// Services log significant operations
logger.debug('[PluginManager] Executing beforeRequest hooks');
logger.warn('[PluginManager] Plugin "deprecated-plugin" is deprecated');
```

**Error Logging**:
```typescript
// Services log errors with context
logger.error('[PluginManager] Failed to load plugin "broken-plugin"', error);
```

### 5.3. Integration Points

Understanding how processors and services interact is crucial for maintenance:

**RequestProcessor ↔ All Processors**: RequestProcessor orchestrates all other processors
**ContextBuilderProcessor ↔ PluginService**: Context building integrates plugin-provided context
**MiddlewareExecutorProcessor ↔ ProcedureService**: Middleware execution uses procedure definitions
**SSEProcessor ↔ RealtimeService**: SSE processor provides low-level API for high-level service
**TelemetryManagerProcessor ↔ Telemetry Adapters**: Processor delegates to configured adapters

## 6. Debugging & Troubleshooting Guide

### 6.1. Logging System Debugging

The centralized logging system provides powerful debugging capabilities when properly configured.

#### Environment Variables for Debugging:
```bash
# Enable debug logging for all components
IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Enable trace logging for maximum verbosity
IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE

# Enable debug logging only for specific components (if implemented)
IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
IGNITER_DEBUG_COMPONENTS=RequestProcessor,RouteResolver
```

#### Common Debugging Scenarios:

**Request Pipeline Issues**:
1. Set `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see request flow
2. Look for `[RequestProcessor]` logs to trace request lifecycle
3. Check `[RouteResolver]` logs for routing issues
4. Monitor `[ContextBuilder]` logs for context creation problems

**Performance Issues**:
1. Set `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE` for detailed timing information
2. Look for `[TelemetryManager]` logs if telemetry is enabled
3. Check processor execution times in logs
4. Monitor memory usage patterns in service initialization logs

**Plugin System Issues**:
1. Enable debug logging: `IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
2. Check `[PluginManager]` logs for plugin loading order
3. Look for plugin hook execution logs
4. Monitor plugin error logs for failures

### 6.2. Request Flow Debugging

When debugging request processing issues, follow this systematic approach:

#### Step 1: Identify the Failure Point
```typescript
// Look for these log patterns to identify where requests fail:

// Request received
"[RequestProcessor] Processing request: GET /api/users"

// Route resolution
"[RouteResolver] Matched route: GET /api/users -> getUsersAction"
"[RouteResolver] No route matched for: GET /unknown"

// Context building
"[ContextBuilder] Built context for request"
"[BodyParser] Parsing JSON body (1.2KB)"

// Middleware execution
"[MiddlewareExecutor] Executing procedure chain: [auth, validation]"
"[MiddlewareExecutor] Procedure 'auth' returned early response"

// Response processing
"[ResponseProcessor] Serializing response (application/json)"

// Error handling
"[ErrorHandler] Handling IgniterError: Validation failed"
```

#### Step 2: Analyze Context and State
```typescript
// Enable context logging in processors:
logger.debug('[ProcessorName] Context state:', {
  requestId: context.requestId,
  route: context.route,
  user: context.user?.id,
  // Add relevant context fields
});
```

#### Step 3: Check Integration Points
- Verify plugin hooks are executing correctly
- Check middleware chain execution order
- Validate context merging between processors
- Ensure telemetry spans are properly created/closed

### 6.3. Common Error Patterns

#### Type Safety Issues:
```typescript
// Symptom: TypeScript compilation errors in action handlers
// Cause: Context type mismatches between processors
// Solution: Check ContextBuilderProcessor and middleware type definitions

// Look for logs like:
"[ContextBuilder] Warning: Context type mismatch detected"
```

#### Performance Degradation:
```typescript
// Symptom: Slow request processing
// Causes: 
// 1. Inefficient route matching
// 2. Heavy middleware chains
// 3. Synchronous operations in async context

// Look for logs like:
"[RouteResolver] Route resolution took 150ms (threshold: 10ms)"
"[MiddlewareExecutor] Procedure chain execution took 500ms"
```

#### Memory Leaks:
```typescript
// Symptom: Increasing memory usage over time
// Causes:
// 1. Unclosed SSE connections
// 2. Plugin event listeners not cleaned up
// 3. Telemetry spans not properly closed

// Look for logs like:
"[SSEProcessor] Warning: 1000+ active connections detected"
"[PluginManager] Warning: Event listener count growing"
"[TelemetryManager] Warning: Unclosed spans detected"
```

### 6.4. Testing and Validation

#### Unit Testing Processors:
```typescript
// When adding new processors or modifying existing ones:
// 1. Test processor in isolation
// 2. Mock dependencies (other processors, services)
// 3. Test error conditions
// 4. Validate logging output

// Example test structure:
describe('RequestProcessor', () => {
  it('should log request processing start', async () => {
    const mockLogger = createMockLogger();
    const processor = new RequestProcessor(mockLogger);
    
    await processor.process(mockRequest);
    
    expect(mockLogger.info).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      '[RequestProcessor] Processing request: GET /api/test'
    );
  });
});
```

#### Integration Testing:
```typescript
// Test processor interactions:
// 1. Full request pipeline tests
// 2. Error propagation tests
// 3. Context passing tests
// 4. Plugin integration tests

// Use IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG in tests to verify logging
process.env.IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG';
```

## 7. Development Best Practices & Code Patterns

### 7.1. Code Organization Patterns

#### File Naming Conventions:
```
Processors: *.processor.ts (e.g., request.processor.ts)
Services: *.service.ts (e.g., plugin.service.ts)
Utilities: *.utils.ts (e.g., logger.utils.ts)
Types: *.types.ts (e.g., context.types.ts)
Interfaces: *.interface.ts (e.g., adapter.interface.ts)
Constants: *.constants.ts (e.g., http.constants.ts)
```

#### Directory Structure Patterns:
```
src/
├── processors/          # Request pipeline processors
├── services/           # Builder and runtime services
├── utils/              # Shared utilities and helpers
├── types/              # Type definitions and interfaces
├── error/              # Error classes and handling
├── client/             # Client-side utilities
└── index.ts            # Public API exports
```

### 7.2. Processor Implementation Patterns

#### Standard Processor Structure:
```typescript
import { IgniterConsoleLogger } from '../utils/logger';
import { resolveLogLevel, createLoggerContext } from '../utils/logger';

export class ExampleProcessor {
  private readonly logger: IgniterConsoleLogger;

  constructor() {
    this.logger = new IgniterConsoleLogger(
      resolveLogLevel(),
      createLoggerContext('ExampleProcessor')
    );
  }

  async process(input: InputType): Promise<OutputType> {
    const requestId = input.requestId || 'unknown';
    
    this.logger.debug(`[ExampleProcessor] Starting processing for request ${requestId}`);
    
    try {
      // Main processing logic
      const result = await this.performProcessing(input);
      
      this.logger.debug(`[ExampleProcessor] Processing completed for request ${requestId}`);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error(`[ExampleProcessor] Processing failed for request ${requestId}`, error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

  private async performProcessing(input: InputType): Promise<OutputType> {
    // Implementation details
  }
}
```

#### Key Patterns:
1. **Consistent Logging**: Always use centralized logger with proper context
2. **Error Handling**: Catch, log, and re-throw errors with context
3. **Request ID Tracking**: Include requestId in all log messages
4. **Private Methods**: Separate public interface from implementation details
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing for inputs and outputs

### 7.3. Service Implementation Patterns

#### Builder Service Pattern:
```typescript
export class ExampleService {
  private readonly logger: IgniterConsoleLogger;
  private readonly config: ExampleConfig;

  constructor(config: ExampleConfig) {
    this.config = config;
    this.logger = new IgniterConsoleLogger(
      resolveLogLevel(),
      createLoggerContext('ExampleService')
    );
    
    this.logger.info(`[ExampleService] Initialized with config`);
    this.logger.debug(`[ExampleService] Config details:`, config);
  }

  // Fluent API methods
  public withOption(option: OptionType): this {
    this.logger.debug(`[ExampleService] Adding option: ${option}`);
    // Implementation
    return this;
  }

  // Factory methods
  public create(): CreatedType {
    this.logger.debug(`[ExampleService] Creating instance`);
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### 7.4. Error Handling Patterns

#### Custom Error Classes:
```typescript
export class IgniterProcessorError extends IgniterError {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly processor: string,
    public readonly requestId?: string,
    cause?: Error
  ) {
    super(message, 'PROCESSOR_ERROR', 500, cause);
    this.name = 'IgniterProcessorError';
  }
}
```

#### Error Logging Pattern:
```typescript
try {
  // Operation that might fail
} catch (error) {
  const processorError = new IgniterProcessorError(
    'Failed to process request',
    'ExampleProcessor',
    requestId,
    error
  );
  
  this.logger.error(
    `[ExampleProcessor] Processing failed for request ${requestId}`,
    processorError
  );
  
  throw processorError;
}
```

### 7.5. Type Safety Patterns

#### Context Type Extensions:
```typescript
// When extending context in processors
export interface ExtendedContext extends ProcessedContext {
  readonly customField: string;
  readonly computedValue: number;
}

// Type-safe context merging
function extendContext<T extends ProcessedContext>(
  context: T,
  extensions: Partial<ExtendedContext>
): T & ExtendedContext {
  return { ...context, ...extensions } as T & ExtendedContext;
}
```

#### Generic Processor Pattern:
```typescript
export abstract class BaseProcessor<TInput, TOutput> {
  protected abstract processInternal(input: TInput): Promise<TOutput>;
  
  async process(input: TInput): Promise<TOutput> {
    // Common logging and error handling
    return this.processInternal(input);
  }
}
```

### 7.6. Testing Patterns

#### Processor Testing:
```typescript
describe('ExampleProcessor', () => {
  let processor: ExampleProcessor;
  let mockLogger: jest.Mocked<IgniterConsoleLogger>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockLogger = createMockLogger();
    processor = new ExampleProcessor();
    // Inject mock logger if needed
  });

  it('should process input successfully', async () => {
    const input = createMockInput();
    const result = await processor.process(input);
    
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(mockLogger.debug).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.stringContaining('[ExampleProcessor] Starting processing')
    );
  });

  it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
    const input = createInvalidInput();
    
    await expect(processor.process(input)).rejects.toThrow();
    expect(mockLogger.error).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

### 7.7. Performance Patterns

#### Lazy Initialization:
```typescript
export class ExampleService {
  private _expensiveResource?: ExpensiveResource;
  
  private get expensiveResource(): ExpensiveResource {
    if (!this._expensiveResource) {
      this.logger.debug('[ExampleService] Initializing expensive resource');
      this._expensiveResource = new ExpensiveResource();
    }
    return this._expensiveResource;
  }
}
```

#### Caching Pattern:
```typescript
export class ExampleProcessor {
  private readonly cache = new Map<string, CachedResult>();
  
  async process(input: InputType): Promise<OutputType> {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(input);
    
    if (this.cache.has(cacheKey)) {
      this.logger.debug(`[ExampleProcessor] Cache hit for key: ${cacheKey}`);
      return this.cache.get(cacheKey)!;
    }
    
    const result = await this.performProcessing(input);
    this.cache.set(cacheKey, result);
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

## 8. Lessons Learned & Framework Evolution Insights

### 8.1. Logging System Refactoring Insights (2024)

During the comprehensive logging system refactoring, several key insights were gained about the framework's architecture and maintenance patterns:

#### Key Discoveries:

**1. Centralized Logging Benefits:**
- **Consistency**: Unified logging approach across all processors and services
- **Configurability**: Single environment variable (`IGNITER_LOG_LEVEL`) controls entire system
- **Debugging**: Easier to trace request flows and identify issues
- **Performance**: Controlled log levels prevent verbose logging in production

**2. Processor Architecture Strengths:**
- **Modularity**: Each processor has a single, well-defined responsibility
- **Composability**: Processors can be easily added, removed, or reordered
- **Testability**: Individual processors can be tested in isolation
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing maintained throughout the pipeline

**3. Service Layer Patterns:**
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent APIs provide excellent developer experience
- **Factory Functions**: Clean separation between configuration and runtime
- **Plugin System**: Event-driven architecture enables extensibility
- **Context Management**: Centralized context building ensures consistency

#### Anti-Patterns Identified and Resolved:

**1. Inconsistent Logging:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Anti-pattern)
console.log('Processing request'); // No context, wrong level
if (config.debug) logger.debug('Debug info'); // Conditional logging

// AFTER (Best practice)
logger.info('[RequestProcessor] Processing request for requestId: 123');
logger.debug('[RequestProcessor] Request details:', requestData);
```

**2. Environment Variable Fragmentation:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Anti-pattern)
const logLevel = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? 'DEBUG' : 'INFO';
const enableDebug = process.env.ENABLE_DEBUG === 'true';

// AFTER (Best practice)
const logLevel = resolveLogLevel(); // Centralized resolution
const logger = new IgniterConsoleLogger(logLevel, createLoggerContext('Component'));
```

**3. Context Inconsistency:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (Anti-pattern)
logger.debug('Route matched'); // No context about which route

// AFTER (Best practice)
logger.debug('[RouteResolver] Matched route: GET /api/users -> getUsersAction');
```

### 8.2. Framework Evolution Patterns

#### Successful Refactoring Strategies:

**1. Incremental Changes:**
- Start with utility functions (`resolveLogLevel`, `createLoggerContext`)
- Update processors one by one
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Test each change thoroughly before proceeding

**2. Centralization Before Optimization:**
- First, centralize all logging to use the same system
- Then, optimize log levels and messages
- Finally, add advanced features (filtering, formatting)

**3. Documentation-Driven Development:**
- Update `AGENT.md` with new patterns as they emerge
- Document anti-patterns to prevent regression
- Provide clear examples for future contributors

#### Future Evolution Considerations:

**1. Telemetry Integration:**
```typescript
// Future enhancement: Structured logging with telemetry
logger.info('[RequestProcessor] Processing request', {
  requestId,
  traceId: telemetry.getTraceId(),
  spanId: telemetry.getSpanId(),
  duration: performance.now() - startTime
});
```

**2. Log Aggregation:**
```typescript
// Future enhancement: Log aggregation support
logger.info('[RequestProcessor] Processing request', {
  '@timestamp': new Date().toISOString(),
  '@level': 'info',
  '@component': 'RequestProcessor',
  '@requestId': requestId,
  message: 'Processing request'
});
```

**3. Performance Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Future enhancement: Built-in performance monitoring
const timer = logger.startTimer('[RequestProcessor] Request processing');
// ... processing logic ...
timer.end(); // Automatically logs duration
```

### 8.3. Maintenance Guidelines for Future AI Agents

#### When Adding New Processors:

1. **Follow the Standard Pattern:**
   - Use centralized logger with `resolveLogLevel()` and `createLoggerContext()`
   - Include requestId in all log messages
   - Use consistent error handling and logging
   - Add comprehensive tests

2. **Integration Checklist:**
   - [ ] Logger initialized with proper context
   - [ ] Error handling follows established patterns
   - [ ] Log messages include relevant context
   - [ ] Tests cover logging behavior
   - [ ] Documentation updated in `AGENT.md`

3. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG for detailed info, INFO for significant events)
   - Avoid logging large objects at INFO level
   - Consider lazy evaluation for expensive log message generation

#### When Modifying Existing Code:

1. **Logging Consistency Check:**
   - Ensure all log messages follow the `[ComponentName]` prefix pattern
   - Verify log levels are appropriate for the message content
   - Check that error logging includes sufficient context

2. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Maintain existing public APIs
   - Deprecate old patterns gradually
   - Provide migration guides for breaking changes

3. **Testing Requirements:**
   - Update tests to verify logging behavior
   - Test error conditions and their logging
   - Ensure log level changes don't break functionality

### 8.4. Framework Health Indicators

#### Positive Indicators:
- Consistent logging patterns across all components
- Clear separation of concerns between processors
- Strong type safety maintained throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

#### Warning Signs:
- Inconsistent logging patterns emerging
- Direct `console.*` usage in new code

## 9. Common Maintenance Tasks (Instructions for AI Agent)

This section provides step-by-step guides for performing common maintenance and enhancement tasks on the `@igniter-js/core` package.

### Task 1: Add a New Option to `igniter.query()`
**Scenario:** We want to add a new top-level option to all query actions, for example, `cacheTTL: number`.

1.  **Objective:** Modify the `createIgniterQuery` factory to accept and process a new option.
2.  **Locate Type Definition:** Open `packages/core/src/types/action.interface.ts`.
3.  **Modify Interface:** Add the new optional property to the `IgniterQueryOptions` type definition.
    ```typescript
    // In IgniterQueryOptions
    export type IgniterQueryOptions<...> = {
      // ... existing options
      cacheTTL?: number; // Add the new option here
    };
    ```
4.  **Locate Implementation:** Open `packages/core/src/services/action.service.ts`.
5.  **Update Factory Function:** In the `createIgniterQuery` function, access the new option from the `options` object and include it in the returned action object.
    ```typescript
    // In createIgniterQuery
    return {
      ...options,
      method: 'GET' as const,
      cacheTTL: options.cacheTTL, // Pass the new option through
      $Infer: {} as TQueryInfer
    } as TQuery;
    ```
6.  **Update Processor:** The logic that *uses* this option would likely reside in the `RequestProcessor`. Open `packages/core/src/processors/request.processor.ts`. In the `executeAction` or `handleSuccessfulResponse` method, you would add logic like:
    ```typescript
    // In RequestProcessor
    if (action.cacheTTL) {
      // Logic to set cache headers on the response
      // e.g., response.headers.set('Cache-Control', `max-age=${action.cacheTTL}`);
    }
    ```
7.  **Write/Update Tests:** Navigate to `packages/core/src/services/__tests__/action.service.test.ts` and add a new test case to verify that the `cacheTTL` option is correctly passed through by the `createIgniterQuery` factory. If applicable, add tests to the `request.processor.test.ts` to verify the new caching behavior.

### Task 2: Add a New Lifecycle Hook to the Request Processor
**Scenario:** We need to add a `beforeRouteResolution` hook that runs before the router tries to find a matching action.

1.  **Objective:** Introduce a new hook into the main request processing pipeline.
2.  **Define Hook Type:** Open `packages/core/src/types/request.processor.ts` (or a more appropriate location like a new `hooks.interface.ts`). Define the function signature for the new hook.
    ```typescript
    // Example hook type definition
    export type BeforeRouteResolutionHook = (request: Request) => Promise<void> | void;
    ```
3.  **Update Router/Builder Configuration:** The hook needs to be configured. Decide where it should be passed. A logical place is in the main `igniter.router()` configuration. Open `packages/core/src/types/router.interface.ts` and add the hook to `IgniterRouterConfig`.
    ```typescript
    // In IgniterRouterConfig
    export interface IgniterRouterConfig<...> {
      // ... existing properties
      beforeRouteResolution?: BeforeRouteResolutionHook;
    }
    ```
4.  **Locate Execution Point:** Open `packages/core/src/processors/request.processor.ts`.
5.  **Implement Hook Execution:** Inside the `process` method, at the very beginning before the call to `RouteResolverProcessor.resolve`, add the logic to execute the hook if it exists on the config.
    ```typescript
    // In RequestProcessor.process
    public async process(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
      // ...
      try {
        // Execute the new hook here
        if (this.config.beforeRouteResolution) {
          await this.config.beforeRouteResolution(request);
        }

        // Step 1: Resolve route (existing logic)
        const routeResult = RouteResolverProcessor.resolve(...);
        // ... rest of the method
    ```
6.  **Write/Update Tests:** Add or modify tests in `packages/core/src/processors/__tests__/request.processor.test.ts` to verify that the hook is called correctly and at the right time. Use `vi.fn()` to mock the hook and assert that it has been called.

### Task 3: Modify the `IgniterCookie` Service
**Scenario:** We need to add a new method, `.toJSON()`, to the `IgniterCookie` class that returns all cookies as a plain object.

1.  **Objective:** Add a new public method to the `IgniterCookie` service.
2.  **Locate Service:** Open `packages/core/src/services/cookie.service.ts`.
3.  **Add New Method:** Add the `toJSON` method to the `IgniterCookie` class.
    ```typescript
    // In IgniterCookie class
    /**
     * Returns all cookies as a plain JavaScript object.
     */
    public toJSON(): Record<string, string> {
      return Object.fromEntries(this.cookies.entries());
    }
    ```
4.  **Write/Update Tests:** Open `packages/core/src/services/__tests__/cookie.service.test.ts`. Add a new `describe` block or `it` block to specifically test the `.toJSON()` method.
    ```typescript
    // In cookie.service.test.ts
    it('should return all cookies as a plain object with toJSON', () => {
      cookies.set('user', 'john');
      cookies.set('theme', 'dark');
      const json = cookies.toJSON();
      expect(json).toEqual({ user: 'john', theme: 'dark' });
    });
    ```
5.  **Final Verification:** Run the entire test suite for the `core` package to ensure your change has not introduced any regressions.

### Task 4: Adding New Logging Capabilities

When extending the centralized logging system with new features:

**Steps:**
1. **Extend Core Utilities:** Modify `src/utils/logger.ts` to add new functionality
2. **Update Logger Interface:** Extend `IgniterConsoleLogger` if needed
3. **Maintain Backward Compatibility:** Ensure existing logging calls continue to work
4. **Update All Components:** Apply new logging patterns consistently across processors and services
5. **Add Tests:** Test new logging functionality and edge cases
6. **Update Documentation:** Document new logging capabilities and usage patterns

**Example - Adding Structured Logging:**
```typescript
// In logger.ts
export function createStructuredLogger(component: string, metadata?: Record<string, any>) {
  const baseContext = createLoggerContext(component);
  return new IgniterConsoleLogger(resolveLogLevel(), {
    ...baseContext,
    ...metadata
  });
}

// Usage in processors
const logger = createStructuredLogger('RequestProcessor', {
  version: '1.0.0',
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
});
```

### Task 5: Refactoring Legacy Code

When updating older code to follow current patterns:

**Steps:**
1. **Identify Anti-Patterns:** Look for direct `console.*` usage, inconsistent error handling, or fragmented configuration
2. **Plan Migration:** Create a step-by-step plan to update the code incrementally
3. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure the code uses centralized utilities (`resolveLogLevel`, `createLoggerContext`)
4. **Standardize Patterns:** Apply consistent logging, error handling, and type safety patterns
5. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify that refactored code maintains the same functionality
6. **Update Documentation:** Reflect changes in `AGENT.md` and inline comments

**Refactoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Replace `console.*` with centralized logger
- [ ] Use `resolveLogLevel()` for log level configuration
- [ ] Apply consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Include comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation
